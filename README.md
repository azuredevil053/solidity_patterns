# Smart-Contract Patterns

A software pattern describes an abstraction or conceptualization of a concrete, complex, and reoccurring problem that
software designers have faced in the context of real software development projects and a successful solution they have
implemented multiple times to resolve this problem [E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, and J. Vlissides, “Design patterns: elements of,” 1994.].

## Patterns

The patterns are divided into five groups.

### Action and Control

Action and Control is a group of patterns that provide mechanisms 
for typical operational tasks.

### Authorization

Authorization is a group of patterns that control access to
smart contract functions and provide basic authorization control,
which simplify the implementation of "user permissions".

### Lifecycle

Lifecycle is a group of patterns that control the creation and
destruction of smart contracts.

### Maintenance

Maintenance is a group of patterns that provide mechanisms
for live operating contracts.

### Security

Security is a group of patterns that introduce safety measures
to mitigate damage and assure a reliable contract execution.
