# Smart-Contract Patterns

A software pattern describes an abstraction or conceptualization of a concrete, complex, and reoccurring problem that
software designers have faced in the context of real software development projects and a successful solution they have
implemented multiple times to resolve this problem [E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, and J. Vlissides, “Design patterns: elements of,” 1994.].

## Patterns

The patterns are divided into five groups.

### Action and Control

### Authorization

### Lifecycle

### Mainenance

### Security
